# Sprint Challenge: User Interface and Git - Multi-Page Website

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored User Interface and Git. During this Sprint, you studied Semantic HTML, CSS Fundamentals, CSS Flexbox Module, and Git. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by creating a multi page website that has some missing HTML elements as well as CSS specificity problems that need to be solved.  You will also create an additional web page that will be linked to from a navigation you will build.

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your PM and Instructor in your cohort help channel on Slack. Your work reflects your proficiency in user interface and your command of the concepts and techniques in semantic HTML, CSS fundamentals, CSS flexbox module, and git.

You have three hours to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly.

## Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons and your project manager.

## Description

In this challenge, you build a missing header (navigation and image) on the home page, update some CSS styling on the home page, and create an additional page (About) which will link from the navigation you created.

In meeting the minimum viable product (MVP) specifications listed below, your web page should look like the solution screen shots of the home and about pages:

## Self-Study Questions

Demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering the following free-form questions.

Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read by your project manager

1. If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
Sementic hypertext markup language or HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the meaning of the information in the web pages rather that to merely define its presentation. We use this language to speak to the computer so it can output our design and thoughts. It is a universal language used by many people all across the globe. 
The benefit of writing semantic HTML stems from what should be the driving goal of any web page â€” the desire to communicate. By adding semantic tags to your document, you provide additional information about that document, which aids in communication.
Ultimately, following semantic web markup practices and using carefully structured and validated code is your best strategy for ensuring that your web content will be useful and visible into the future.

2. Name two big differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
Display block means that the element is displayed as a block. It has some whitespace above and below it and tolerates no NTML elements next to it, except when ordered otherwise. 
Display inline means that the element is displayed inline, inside the curent block on the same line.
Compared to display inline, the major difference is that display block allows to set a width and height on the elemnet. Also with block the top and bottom margins/padding are respected, but inline they are not. 

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
Every box is composed of four parts or areas, defined by their respective edges: the content edge, padding edge, border edge, and margin edge. 

4. While using flexbox, what axis does the following property work on: ```align-items: center```?
It is on the cross axis. We use justify-content to align the item on the main axis. 

5. Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.
Git is the most popular and widely used version control system today. A huge number of developers rely upon Git version controlling to develop several types of commercial and non-commercial projects. Git based developers are well thought of and considered as valuable resources. 
Git is valuable to a team of developers because there are several advantages of Git. Git performs very strongly and reliably when compared to other version control systems. New code changes can be easily commited, version branches can be effortlessly compared and merged, and code can also be optimized to perform better. Another expample is its security feature. Git is designed specially to maintain the integrity of source code. File contents as well as the relationship between file and directories, tags, commits, versions etc. are secured cryptographically using an algorithm called SHA1 which protects the code and change history against accidental as well as malicious damage. You can be sure to have an authentic content history for your soruce code with Git. In addtion, a key design objective of Git is the kind of flexibility it offers to support several kinds of nonlinear development workflows and its efficiency in handling both small scale and large scale projects as well as protocols. Finally, Git is used widely by many developers and the accesiblility of the open source projects allows the quality of open source software made available on Git with heavily scrutinized a countless number of times and businesses today depending heavily on Git's code quality.
Git's work flow allows developers to branch their projects, distribute its development amonts other teams by asking for a pull request to seek help from their team where they can grab the code and edit it without tampering with the master code so they can make as many changes on it as possible. Git is very popular, widely used, and accepted as standard version control system by the vast majority within the developer's community. 


You are expected to be able to answer all these questions. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. Skipping this section *will* prevent you from passing this challenge.

## Project Set Up

- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project.
- [ ] Add your project manager as collaborator on Github.
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Lambda's by mistake!).
- [ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
- [ ] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly.
- [ ] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`.
 
Follow these steps for completing your project.

- [ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student's  Repo). **Please don't merge your own pull request**
- [ ] Add your project manager as a reviewer on the pull-request
- [ ] Your project manager will count the project as complete by merging the branch back into master.
 


## Minimum Viable Product

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

### Home Page

[Review the provided design file for the home page](design-files/home.png).  Notice the navigation and header images are missing.

* [ ] Build the HTML and CSS to create the missing navigation and header.
* [ ] Link the `About` navigation item to the [about.html](about.html) page

You will also notice there are 10 boxes on the home page that need background colors.  Use this list below to correctly style each box:

* [ ] box1: `teal`
* [ ] box2: `gold`
* [ ] box3: `cadetblue`
* [ ] box4: `coral`
* [ ] box5: `crimson`
* [ ] box6: `forestgreen`
* [ ] box7: `darkorchid`
* [ ] box8: `hotpink`
* [ ] box9: `indigo`
* [ ] box10: `dodgerblue`

### About Page

[Review the provided design file for the about page](design-files/about.png). You have been provided the HTML wrapper, footer, and page content for the about page. Create the rest of the missing HTML and CSS to match the design file.

* [ ] Copy and paste your home page navigation and header into the about page
* [ ] Update the header image with the about page image
* [ ] Link the `Home` navigation item back to the `index.html` page.
* [ ] Build the rest of the about page layout to match the design

In your solution, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results. Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work. It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP than one that attempts too much and does not.

## Stretch Problems

After finishing your required elements, you can push your work further. These goals may or may not be things you have learned in this module but they build on the material you just studied. Time allowing, stretch your limits and see if you can deliver on the following optional goals:

* [ ] Build a page of your choosing from the navigation items.  Come up with content and images that fit the theme.  
* [ ] Introduce CSS animations to your site.
* [ ] Build a contact page and create a form with several inputs of your choosing
* [ ] Add responsive breakpoints to your code by using media queries
